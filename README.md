# Google TTS

A Javascript API for the Google's text-to-Speech engine and is based on code at http://weston.ruter.net/projects/google-tts/.

**NOTE:** Playback (`.play()` below) will only work when running the script locally as Google's server only
returns audio if you can prevent the browser from sending the Referrer HTTP Header to their server. If you want to add
background playback to your online site perhaps [SoundManager](http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/)
will do the trick (I haven't tested this). On the other hand, I'm assumng this will still work in Phonegap apps.

## Features

* Converts upto 42 languages
* Supports playback through [HTML5 Audio tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/En/HTML/Element/Audio) if available in browser.
* Asynchronous playback API
* Small and compact: ~1 KB minified and gzipped

## Installation

Add the following inside your HTML `<body>` tag, near the bottom:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.github.com/hiddentao/google-tts/master/google-tts.min.js"></script>
